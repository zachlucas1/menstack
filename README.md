To initiate the back-end project letâ€™s create a new empty project folder:
$ mkdir backend

Create a package.json file inside that folder by using the following command:
$ npm init -y

To add some dependencies to the project:
$ npm install express body-parser cors mongoose

Install a global package by executing the following command:
$ npm install -g nodemon
